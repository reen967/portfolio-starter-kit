# Arina Berezovsky

Arina Berezovsky is a systems innovator, writer, and ex-startup founder. In 2021, she founded [Let Me Graduate](https://letmegraduate.softr.app/), an aggregated directory of articulation agreements between colleges and learning opportunity providers, to help individuals navigate and access pathways to upward mobility. The database is regularly updated but the project was put on hold in December 2023 for reasons broken down in this post rather dramatically titled [start-up post-mortem](https://www.arinaberezovsky.com/posts/let-me-graduate-post-mortem).

Arina graduated from Excelsior College in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Her professional interests stem from her personal experience navigating the U.S. higher education system. Arina's degree is a combination of learning opportunities spanning over a dozen providers earned between the ages of 14 and 25 - representing both the flexibility and complexity of navigating the pathway to a degree.
