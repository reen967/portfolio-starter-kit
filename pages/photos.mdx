# Ideas

Here are some of my ideas. Like a wandering thought they're dreamy and incomplete. The process is very much "wouldn't it be cool if..." 

Feel free to constructively or unconstructively criticize, share your musings on what could be, or simply take a minute to close your eyes and construct a lateral portrait of your expertise and experiences.

1. dream - what if...?
2. ideate - considering the fixed constraints of our world, how can this actually work? (the key here is to make the distinction between _real_ and _perceived_ constraints.)
3. innovate - make it happen.
