# Skills Taxonomies

A taxonomy is a classification system. A skills taxonomy provides a framework for understanding skills allowing us to assess:

- what people can do,
- what organizations need people to do,
- identify the people who can do those things,
- identify and recommend learning content.

In higher education skills taxonomies can help institutions assess prior learning, preventing learners from unnecessarily repeating material they are already competent in, and identify knowledge gaps to make recommendations on the learning materials that can be used to fill them.

In the workplace skills taxonomies can help employers in the recruitment process by identifying qualified candidates. They also serve to help employers identify current talent in their organization and develop personalized learning plans to upskill individuals with the potential to fulfill organizational needs.

_tbh taxonomies are confusing and I'm not a data scientist so won't delve any further into the details._

I started this website as a sort of container of ideas. If you've stumbled across this, hi! Feel free to point out the flaws in my logic. Now onto the taxonomy. 

When I was working on Let Me Graduate (if you don't know about it, I suggest you read _this_. It's the anchor of my thought process and most of what I discuss can be traced back to what I wanted to achieve with the startup.)

We're really bad at understanding what people can do. We're also really bad at describing what we need from people to achieve what we're trying to do. Resumes are bad. Job descriptions are bad. Degrees aren't _actually_ useful ways of understanding the skills someone has acquired, nor are they equitable ways of doing so. It feels like everyone is trying to communicate and add value but doesn't have the language to do so, leading to a ton of misunderstanding and inefficiency.

Imagine this: you are an employer looking to hire a junior accountant and you receive three applications for the position. For the purpose of the exercise, this is all the information you have about the candidates:

- Candidate #1 has a Bachelor of Accounting from the University of Southern California (USC)
- Candidate #2 also has a Bachelor of Accounting from the University of Southern California (USC)
- Candidate #3 has a Bachelor of Accounting from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)

How do you determine which candidate is best suited for the position? They all have the same degree (Bachelor of Science in Accounting.) Candidate #1 and Candidate #2 earned their degree from the same university (USC) and Candidate #3 earned their degree from SNHU. Employers will likely rule out Candidate #3 by comparing SNHU's 92.1% acceptance rate to USC's 12.5% acceptance rate. The candidates are evaluated on perceived prestige rather than the skills they have and the employer still doesn't understand the skills gained from a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from either university.

Let's say you had a bit more information about the programs. This is
