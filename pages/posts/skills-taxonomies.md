# Skills Taxonomies

A taxonomy is a classification system. A skills taxonomy provides a framework for understanding skills allowing us to assess:

- what people can do,
- what organizations need people to do,
- identify the people who can do those things,
- identify and recommend learning content.

In higher education skills taxonomies can help institutions assess prior learning, preventing learners from unnecessarily repeating material they are already competent in, and identify knowledge gaps to make recommendations on the learning materials that can be used to fill them.

In the workplace skills taxonomies can help employers in the recruitment process by identifying qualified candidates. They also serve to help employers identify current talent in their organization and develop personalized learning plans to upskill individuals with the potential to fulfill organizational needs.
