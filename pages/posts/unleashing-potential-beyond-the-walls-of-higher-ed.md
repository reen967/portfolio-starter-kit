# Unleashing Potential: Beyond the Walls of Higher Ed

In the complex dance between education and the workforce, the impetus for recognizing learning often rests on the shoulders of postsecondary institutions. However, this creates a formidable barrier for the 20% of working-age Americans with [Some College No Degree (SCND)](https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/SCNCReportMay2022.pdf), whose learning experiences defy easy evaluation by employers. The narrative surrounding non-traditional postsecondary learning has long suggested that employers undervalue it. Yet, the real issue may not be a lack of appreciation but rather a lack of tools to evaluate and understand this learning.

It’s a truth we must confront: employers are often unsure how to assess and contextualize learning that doesn’t neatly fit into the traditional credential mold. If equipped with the right tools, they might well recognize and value non-traditional learning on par with a conventional postsecondary credential. This predicament places the burden on institutions to bridge the gap, compartmentalizing the diverse skills and competencies of learners within the contextual scope comprehensible by the workplace.

In this evolving landscape, postsecondary institutions find themselves taking on a more vocational role, a shift that challenges the traditional understanding of their purpose. As they prepare learners for the workforce, institutions grapple with the delicate balance between their goals of delivering an education that cultivates citizenship along a liberal arts focused curriculum, and the professional development of learners to meet the needs of employers. It’s a balancing act that has seen tensions arise that leaves both parties dissatisfied.

Reflecting on the historical context, [Dougherty (1994)](https://www.amazon.com/Contradictory-College-Conflicting-Community-Frontiers/dp/0791419568) noted that local businesses supported community colleges not only for the sake of educational opportunities but also to secure publicly subsidized employee training. This underscores the multifaceted role institutions play in the broader societal framework, now increasingly expected to resemble white-collar vocational training centers.

In a notable shift, as reflected in the updated weightings of [US News rankings](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights), there is a clear change in how institutions are evaluated. It can be deduced that we’ll soon see evident pressure that the success of institutions should be intimately tied to the graduates’ ability to secure employment that aligns with their earned credentials. Institutions have held an incremental role in the past and now more firmly maintain in guiding the career trajectories of their graduates.

This shift in focus, however, has led to confusion for institutions and employers, as each navigates its evolving role in shaping the future workforce. Yet, beyond these institutional and employer challenges lies the heart of the matter: the learners and their journey. People are the lifeblood of progress, and an inability to recognize the potential within our human capital is sure to impede the progress of the nation. While discussions often center on meeting learners where they are and acknowledging their diverse learning paths, the goal for this recognition should extend beyond mere employability.

Recognizing learning, seeing the individual for all they have learned and traversed to encompass their unique concoction of knowledge and perspective, serves as a catalyst for personal passion and momentum. For learners to thrive, they need assurance that their journey is valued, that skills acquired hold merit, and that there is transparency and clarity in the path to reaching their goals. The lack of such transparency and clarity becomes a demotivator, hindering the entire human-capital-enhancing ecosystem.

Moreover, it is crucial to acknowledge that a learner’s momentum through a pathway and their confidence that their learning will be recognized contribute directly to increased retention and graduation rates. When learners feel their efforts are acknowledged and valued, it creates a [positive feedback loop](https://evolllution.com/programming/credentials/how-credit-for-prior-learning-has-the-opportunity-to-create-new-prosperity-in-higher-education), fostering a sense of belonging and purpose.

The importance of recognizing learning goes beyond the confines of higher education and beyond the context of the workforce. By bridging the gap between education and work we can empower individuals by acknowledging the potential of every learner and the significance and value of their unique experiences. Enhancing our mechanisms by which we contextualize learning has the potential to diversify the skills and increase the potential of the workforce. As we navigate this evolving landscape, let us not lose sight of the learners at the center of it — the driving force behind progress and innovation.
